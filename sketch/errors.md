# Error Handling

I don't think exceptions are fundamental enough.  They can be implemented in terms of condition and restart.  I need to spend more time working with Common Lisp's condition and restart system to understand if it's really as flexible and productive as I think it is.  See my [previous thoughts](http://blog.ndrix.com/2013/02/programming-for-failure.html) about error handling.
