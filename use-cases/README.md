Any programming language should be able to comfortably and cleanly (subjective criteria) accommodate the uses cases described in this directory.  These are use cases that occur frequently in "real world" software development.

Each use case should be described in high level terms that don't favor one implementation over another. Each language may choose a different, clean way to accomplish the goal.

Support for these uses cases should be included in the standard library.

## Examples

Each subdirectory includes code that I wrote in the course of my daily work.  The code is copied exactly as it was in the original project.

Next to this file is a speculative Amalog implementation.  It shows how I wish I had been able to solve the problem, had Amalog existed.

These examples, written without reference to a specific implementation, should help me keep Amalog grounded in accomplishing productive work.
