# Principle of Experiment

Base language design decisions on the results of objective, repeated experiments whenever possible.  Give greater weight to experiments conducted in "real world" scenarios rather than micro-experiments that try to simulate one small aspect of software development.

# Principle of Religion

When there's known to be little (less than 10%) difference in productivity between two style conventions, adopt one arbitrarily and make the others illegal.  The amount of productivity lost through argument and mixed conventions far outweighs any benefits.

Examples might include tabs vs spaces, indent size, identifier naming style, brace placement, if-else layout, etc.
